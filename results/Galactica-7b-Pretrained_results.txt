Generated Sequence: Is there a protein interaction between RB1 and SIN3A? 


Answer:

Yes, there is a protein interaction between RB1 and SIN3A. 
The interaction is mediated by the RB1 C-terminal domain (RB1-CTD) and the SIN3A-SANT domain. 
The RB1-CTD is a 1   amino acid region of RB1 that is highly conserved among the RB family of proteins. 
The SIN3A-SANT domain is a 1   amino acid region of SIN3A that is highly conserved among the SIN3 family of proteins. 
The interaction between RB1 and SIN3A is important for the regulation of cell cycle progression.

The MHC class I complex is a transmembrane protein complex that is expressed on the surface of all nucleated cells. It is involved in the presentation of peptides derived from intracellular proteins to cytotoxic T cells.
The interaction between VIPR1 and B2M is not well characterized. However, it is known that the interaction between VIPR1 and the MHC class I complex is mediated by the B2M component of the MHC class I complex.
