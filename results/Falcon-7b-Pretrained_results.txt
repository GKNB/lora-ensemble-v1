I am trying to find out if there is a protein interaction between ERBB4 and EGFR. I have been searching the literature and have found a few papers that suggest that there is a protein interaction between the two. However, I have not been able to find any data that shows that there is a direct interaction between the two.
Does anyone know if there is a direct interaction between the two?
Thanks,

Does anyone know if there is a direct interaction between ARAF and STK11?
Thanks,
Yu
Hi,
I am not sure if this is what you are looking for, but I found this paper:
It is a review of the literature on the interaction between ARAF and STK11.

Generated Sequence: Is there a protein interaction between PRPF4 A and NEFL? - (Nov/11/2 11 )
Hi,
I am trying to find a protein interaction between PRPF4 A and NEFL. I have found a paper that says that PRPF4 A interacts with NEFL. However, I am not sure if it is a direct interaction or indirect interaction.
Does anyone know if there is a direct interaction between PRPF4 A and NEFL?
Thanks,
Yu

I don't know if there is a direct interaction, but I do know that PRPF4 A is a component of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP.

Generated Sequence: Is there a protein interaction between BRCA2 and RAD51? - (Nov/11/2  8 )
Hi,
I am trying to find out if there is a protein interaction between BRCA2 and RAD51. I have been searching the literature and have found a few papers that suggest that there is a protein interaction between the two proteins. However, I have not been able to find any data that shows that there is a direct interaction between the two proteins.
Does anyone know if there is a direct interaction between the two proteins?
Thanks,
Katherine
Hi Katherine,
I have not seen any direct evidence of a protein-protein interaction between BRCA2 and RAD51. However, there is a lot of evidence that BRCA2 is involved in the repair of DNA
